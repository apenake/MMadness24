# March Madness 2024

## Personal project using Kaggle dataset to try to win my family's March Madness pool

I've always loved basketball and March Madness is no exception. This year's tournament was a lot of fun. Each year we do a family pool
and I thought it would be interesting to use machine learning to make my predictions. Using Kaggle's dataset, I wrote Python code that
would align matchups and make predictions.

## Turns out....I won the Men's Bracket!
While this code was far from optimized, I envision refinining it in future years. This particular code relies too heavily on data from past seasons
and not enough on how a team is trending leading into the tournament or individual breakout stars. Regardless, this code finished in the top half on 
Kaggle and is a good baseline for future years.
